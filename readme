## MASTER BRANCH ##

Moved entire project to one repository to keep everything tidy, hopefully.

This is the main working directory for our capstone project. 

I figure we could put anything extra related to the project here, if need be.

Even though this is the main directory for the site, it isn't served from here,
instead it's served from the Website subfolder as it's a Django project.
The actual capstone site can be accessed at: http://tracker.cwardcode.com


Folder Layout:
 --.gitignore <-- Used to ignore the extra GPSTracker folder located only 
                  on the server.
 --TrackerClients <-- Holds mobile client applications
 |--Android <-- Holds andorid client app
 |--iOS <-- Holds apple client app
 --TranTrackerGPSApp <-- Holds the GPS Transmitter app
 --Website <-- Holds our django website - see its readme for more details
 --GPSTracker <--- After I cloned the repo onto the server so we can push
                   the site to the repo more easily, reconfiguring apache 
                   didn't work with the new /www/capstone/Website/ dir.
                   So, for now we're going to just ignore it
