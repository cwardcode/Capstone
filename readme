Moved entire project to one repository to keep everything tidy, hopefully.

This is the main working directory for our capstone project. 

I figure we could put anything extra related to the project here, if need be.

Even though this is the main directory for the site, it isn't served from here,
instead it's served from the Website subfolder as it's a Django project.
The actual capstone site can be accessed at: http://tracker.cwardcode.com


Folder Layout:
 --TrackerClients <-- Holds mobile client applications
 |--Android <--holds andorid client app
 |--iOS <-- holds apple client app
 |__
 --TranGPSTracker <---Holds the GPS Transmitter app
 --Website <---Holds our django website - see its readme for more details
