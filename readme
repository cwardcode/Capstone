## MASTER BRANCH ##

This is the main working directory for our capstone project. 

Even though this is the main repo for the project, the site isn't served from here,
instead it's served from the Website subfolder since it is a Django project.

The actual capstone site can be accessed at: http://tracker.cwardcode.com


Folder Layout:
 -Dist - Not currently used, in the future, we can put alpha/beta apks here.
 -TrackerClients <-- Holds mobile client applications.
 |--Android <-- Holds andorid client app.
 |--iOS <-- Holds apple client app.
 -TranTrackerGPSApp <-- Holds the GPS Transmitter app.
 -Website <-- Holds our django website - see its readme for more details.
